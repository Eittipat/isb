# The ISB standard libraries.

A standard library is either a built-in library or a named library:

* Built-in library: the library defined by `BuiltIn.cs`. The functions of the
  built-in library are accessed without lib name by the BASIC code. E.g.:
  `Print(x+y)`, etc. There is no properties defined in the built-in library (to
  avoid ambiguity between variable names and property names).
* Named library: each named library is defined by a separate C# class. The
  functions and the properties of a named libraries are accessed via
  `LibName.EntryName`. E.g.: `Math.Sin(x)`, `Math.Pi`, etc.

The names of libraries, functions and properties are case insensitive in BASIC
code. E.g., `Math.Pi` is the same thing as `math.pi`, `Math.PI` or `MATH.PI`.

## Note

All the c# classes in the `ISB.Lib` namespace (under this dir) are loaded as
ISB standard libraries automatically. Do NOT put non-lib classes here.

## Functions

For a library definition class, all public methods that fulfill the following
criteria are loaded as the functions of that library automatically:

* The method must not be an inherited method, i.e., it must not have the
  `override` modifier.
* The method must have zero or a definite number of arguments. The `params`
  keyword is not allowed.
* The `out` parameter modifier is not allowed.
* Optional parameters are not allowed.
* The type of all the arguments must be either `ISB.Runtime.BaseValue` or a
  derived class of `ISB.Runtime.BaseValue`, such as `ISB.Runtime.NumberValue`,
  `ISB.Runtime.StringValue` or `ISB.Runtime.ArrayValue`.
* If the return type is not void, it must be either `ISB.Runtime.BaseValue` or
  a derived class of `ISB.Runtime.BaseValue`.

For example:

```CSharp
namespace ISB.Lib
{
    [Preserve]
    public class Math
    {
        [Doc("Returns the sine of the specified angle.")]
        [Preserve]
        public NumberValue Sin(NumberValue x) {
            double value = System.Math.Sin(Convert.ToDouble(x.ToNumber()));
            return new NumberValue(Convert.ToDecimal(value));
        }
    }
}
```

## Properties

For a library definition class, all public properties that fulfill the
following criteria are loaded as the properties of that library automatically:

* The type of the property must be either `ISB.Runtime.BaseValue` or a
  derived class of `ISB.Runtime.BaseValue`.

As for the accessibility of the exported properties:

* If the property has both the public getter and the public setter, the
  property is writable from the BASIC code.
* If the property has only the public getter, the property is readonly from
  the BASIC code.

For example, the following code defines a readonly property. Its value is
initialized by the class constructor:

```CSharp
namespace ISB.Lib
{
    [Preserve]
    public class Math
    {
        [Doc("The constant Ï€.")]
        [Preserve]
        public NumberValue Pi { get; private init; }

        public Math()
        {
            this.Pi = new NumberValue(3.1415926);
        }
    }
}
```

## `[Doc]` and `[Preserve]` Attributes

The `[Doc]` attribute is used to provide a description to a library function or
a library property.

When defining library classes, the attribute `[Preserve]` can be used to
preventing Unity from stripping the library code. See Unity's [Managed code
stripping](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ManagedCodeStripping.html) for more
details.
